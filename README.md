# ScholarStream

## Project Overview
**ScholarStream** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application designed to connect students with scholarship opportunities. This platform allows universities or organizations to post scholarships while enabling students to search, apply, and track their applications seamlessly.

### Purpose
Finding scholarships can be a complex and time-consuming process. ScholarStream simplifies this by creating a centralized platform where:
- Students can discover opportunities they might otherwise miss.
- Administrators can efficiently manage applications.
- Moderators can review and update application statuses.

## How the System Works
1. **Students:**  
   - Browse available scholarships.  
   - View detailed scholarship information.  
   - Apply by paying an application fee.  

2. **Moderators:**  
   - Review student applications.  
   - Provide feedback.  
   - Update application status: `Pending → Processing → Completed`.

3. **Admins:**  
   - Manage users (students, moderators).  
   - Add, edit, or remove scholarships.  
   - Access analytics for insights on applications and payments.

## Key Features
- User authentication (students, moderators, admins)
